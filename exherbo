Adding deprecation info directly into the eclass file feels wrong to

nobody will ever do that, but we're talking theory here - so we

%
<@Calchan> zlin, how about we solve the issueslinked to having more 
           than one eapi used in the same tree first ?

<@Ken69267> so.. is there a way to access image/ in src_install

       love how you think, the things you're interested in, the little
       things you told me about your past, the fact that we have the 
       same taste in music and movies. I did sense you put up walls to
       cut off emotions. And you told me you did. I wanted to break 
       through them, maybe a bit too soon, and a bit too intensely.

< cokehabit> gentoofan23: the problem paludis runs into is that it

             massive use of C++ templates but also the developer's 
             lack of understanding

< Philantrop> nemysis: Yes, it's called the "KDE herd".
%
< Philantrop> reavertm: It can use Portage's config. Which is, I have
              to admit it, one of its greatest flaws.
%
< reavertm> paludis would be very fine if it shared portage syntax - 
            it could even became portage replacement in that case 
            maybe - unfortunately Ciaran likes to make things look 
            they are done his way

          about how it handles this situation, counter-intuitive as it
          may seem.

%
< ciaranm> ahf has yet to learn that there is more to sex than 
           ejaculating after three seconds and then falling asleep
%
< ahf> the only time i've felt asleep during sex was before i ejaculated 
< ahf> AND THAT WAS IN THE POOPER
%
< ciaranm> i don't know what that means but it has stag, glue and 
           lichen in it, so it's probably illegal
%
< ahf> when you are not talking about other guys penises, you are 
      talking about nazis 
< ciaranm> i can talk about both at the same time if you want!

             will share.. I'm not sure how much logic I should put 
             into the eclass and how much I should boiler-plate into 
             the ebuilds.. for example. I need to export 100+ env 
             variables for the build.. and then during the install 
             phase change only ROOT

%
< xenoterracide> so if I put it in package.use.mask would I have to 
                 put it in all the profiles? or is there one that is

         not put it in an overlay. Crontab kicked in and ran a --sync 
         and deleted it. Example: http://rafb.net/p/GobZro44.html

< berniyh> hm, is it intentional, that his name sounds like "revert 'em"?
